            <p>Hey! It's me Alex, I'm 24 years old and I live in New York City. I graduated from a small liberal arts college in 2019 and in the time since have worked at an Advertising Agency and at a Financial Recruitment Firm. In both roles I've been exposed to technology and people who create ambitious programs. As a lifelong builder who has always enjoyed putting things together, I'm very excited to begin my professional career as a Software Engineer studying at the Flatiron School. If you're interested in getting in touch or even just saying hello take a look at my contact page and I look forward to hearing from you soon!</p>
